## About this Project
This project investigates **how demographic and clinical factors influence the likelihood of having diabetes**. Using the NHANES dataset, I analyzed variables like **Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, and Total Cholesterol** to understand their relationship with diabetes.

---

## Key Highlights
- Diabetic individuals tend to be **older** and have **higher BMI**.
- **Age** and **BMI** are the strongest predictors of diabetes.
- Gender and Smoking Status show smaller, non-significant effects.
- Including Total Cholesterol adds minimal predictive value.

## What You Will Find
- **Diabetes_Project.Rmd** → The RMarkdown source file with all code, analysis, and commentary.
- **Diabetes_Project_Report.html** → The full report with plots and results, viewable in any browser.

---

## Tools & Methods
- **R** and packages like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `pROC`  
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations  
- Group comparisons using t-tests  
- Logistic regression modeling  
- ROC analysis for evaluating predictive accuracy

## How to Explore
1. Open **Diabetes_Project.Rmd** in RStudio to see the full analysis and run the code yourself.  
2. Open **Diabetes_Project_Report.html** in a browser to see the report with charts and tables.
